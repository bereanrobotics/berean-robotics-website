      - I'm looking forward to having time to dig deeper and taking time to understand and apply some of the software and technology that we haven't had time for in past years. It will be wonderful to see SPQR expand our CAD modeling to animate the robot.
      - I love my Aussie Doodle, and horses and someday, I hope to see a live platypus.

      - I think this is a great chance for us to get much better at communicating with each other online. We have done some of this in the past but it is time to accelerate. With a longer season we can take much more time planning and designing.
      - As for animals, I agree I’d like to see a platypus. I also love otters.
